 * Weight Interface

 * This interface defines the weighting mechanism for computing one weight
 * number from a vector of test results.  It provides one method, compute,
 * which takes the vector of test results and produces one final number.  This
 * is arbitrarily defined, and the user may define any compute function they
 * wish.  For ease of use, the vector will be an associative array, with the
 * name of the stages as keys.
